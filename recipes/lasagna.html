Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>
<li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.</li>
<li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.*</li>
